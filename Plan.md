## Type of Trip
My suggestion would be a Tree House for accomodation (so prob glamping) at least if the weather is crap we are not soaked in a tent or leaky caravan!

## What are you going to do for food?
The suggestion would be to bring food that does not require a fridge, so the following foods:
  1. Porridge
  2. beans
  3. spaghetti
  4. noodles
  5. canned tuna
  6. marshmallows 
  7. popcorn
